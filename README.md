**Fake News Detection using Machine Learning**

**A project by Aditya D Devmurari.**

Abstract
The rapid adoption of social media has led to an unprecedented rate of information dissemination, but it has also increased the spread of content that is misleading or has no basis in reality. This project addresses the challenging task of automatically classifying a text article as misinformation or disinformation.

To tackle this, a machine learning ensemble approach is used for the automated classification of news articles. The study explores various textual properties to distinguish fake content from real news. By leveraging these properties, a combination of different machine learning algorithms are trained using ensemble methods, and their performance is evaluated on real-world datasets, where the ensemble approach has shown superior performance.

The project is programmed in Python.

Project Overview
This project provides a Python-based tool for identifying fake news. It uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze and classify articles. The code is based on a research paper and is designed to serve as a strong foundation for building more complex fake news detection systems.

**Key Features:**

Automated classification of news content.

Uses an ensemble of models, including MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.

Employs TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer for text feature extraction.

Includes a data processing pipeline to handle missing values and consolidate text fields for analysis.
